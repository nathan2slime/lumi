### 👾 Environment variables

> If you are using Docker, you will not need to configure a .env . I left a file ```.env.prod``` with environment variables needed to run in a Docker environment.

> There is a .env.example file where there are examples of how to configure environment variables

### 🧁 Setup

Start by downloading the repository using this Git command.

```
git clone https://github.com/nathan2slime/lumi.git
```

Enter the project directory.

```
cd lumi
```

### 🚀 Running

- Using Docker

  > Run the command below, make sure the ports configured in .env.prod are available.

  ```
  docker compose up
  ```

 - No Docker

   Create the ```.env``` file with the environment variables configured.

   > Run the following commands, make sure you are using a package manager that supports workspaces. For this project I recommend using Yarn in its PKG version.
  
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
    ```
    yarn dotenv -e .env -- yarn build
    ```

    > If you have been successful so far, run the following commands on different terminals. Make sure the PostgreSQL database is running,
    with the database created and its name referenced in the ```.env```, along with the credentials.

    This runs a seed that creates the administrator user with necessary rules and permissions.
    
    ```
    yarn seed
    ```
  
   This runs the API for extracting data from a PDF.
    
    ```
    yarn dev --filter=@lumi/service
    ```

    This runs the API GraphQL
    ```
    yarn dev --filter=@lumi/api
    ```

    This runs the web application in Next.js.
    ```
    yarn dev --filter=@lumi/web
    ```
### ✔️ Testing
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used to implement tests.

  - UT

    To run the unit tests, run the command below.
    
    > The following command depends on the build command (```yarn build```), consider running them first if you haven't done so before.

    ```
      yarn test
    ```
  - Cov
    
    To run coverage tests, run the command below.

    > The following command depends on the build command (```yarn build```), consider running them first if you haven't done so before.

    ```
      yarn test:cov
    ```

### 🔖 Docs
The extraction API documentation is available in the ```/api/docs``` route and the GraphQL API PLayground GraphQL is available in ```/graphql```. Make sure you put the correct host and port to access them

### 🤙 Usage
To interact with the Lumi application, authentication is required. Follow the steps below to manage users and create invoices:

1. **User authentication:**
    - Log in using your admin credentials (You can find them in your .env).
    - If you don't have an admin account, create a regular user account.

2. **Invoice creation:**
    - Only admin users have the privilege to create invoices.

3. **Invoice creation page:**
    - Navigate to the "New Bill" section by clicking on your avatar, available in the side menu.
    - Select the "New bill" option from the dropdown menu.

4. **New invoice:**
    - On the invoice creation page, you can upload an invoice.
    - Validate the extracted data to ensure accuracy.
